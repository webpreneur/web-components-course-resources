# HTML Templates

- The content of the `<template>` element is considered inactive and does not participate in normal page rendering.
- Can be dynamically populated with content using JavaScript.
- Can be used to generate the structure of a web page or component in a clean and efficient manner.
- Allow for creating dynamic and **reusable** templates.

```html
<template>

</template>
```
