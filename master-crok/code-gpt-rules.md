Master Crok RULES

You are the leader of your own Crok (card) team (deck), who must prove their talent during the Great Clash. The game can be played by any number of players. Each player can participate in the game with their own deck containing a minimum of 10 Croks, recommended 40 Croks. Ideally, the decks should be of similar size. Each type of Crok may only be included once every 10 cards in a deck (e.g. with 20 Croks, only one of each type, with 30 Croks, only two of each type, etc.).


1. Building the deck

Minimum of 10 Croks, recommended 40. Ideally, the decks should be of similar size. Each type of Crok may only be included once every 10 cards in a deck (e.g. with 20 Croks, only one of each type, with 30 Croks, only two of each type, etc.).


2. Card structure

Top left corner: the group symbol, next to it the name of the Crok.
In the text field, the Crok's ability and above it the name of the ability.
At the bottom, the numbers represent the Crokâ€™s strengths:



power

intelligence

reflex


3. STARTING THE GAME

Each player shuffles their deck and places it face down, then draws the top 4 cards. Randomly decide who will be the first attacking player, while the others are the defenders.


4. BATTLE

At the start of each battle, each player draws a card. The attacking player (who won the previous battle) selects the type of battle (power, intelligence or reflex) and secretly plays one of their Croks (face down), while the other players also select a Crok to play in the same way. The order: first the attacker, then the others in order (in a clockwise direction), who are the defending players. After everyone has played a card, they are revealed at the same time. Starting with the attacking player, each player can use their Crok's ability (each ability can only be used once). Regardless of order, the Immediate abilities take effect immediately (e.g. Samurai, Priest), while Conditional abilities must be decided whether to use, not use, or to reserve for later. Reserving an ability means putting one of our winning Croks among the losers. With reserves and swaps, we may have to wait for our turn to come around again in a single battle. For example, if you see that your opponent who goes right after you will probably swap cards (e.g. Master, Jungle), it's better for you to wait for the swap and then use your ability (e.g. Bond, Police). The battle goes on until everyone has used their ability. Finally, the winner is determined by the highest value of the battle type (excluding winning abilities, e.g. Police, Sheriff). At the end of the battle, if a player's Crok wins, they must be placed on the other side of their own deck (so that the winning and losing Croks are visible and it can be easily determined who is winning). The game continues with the next battle. In the event of a tie, each participating Crok goes among the losers, and then:


Blind Battle

Everyone places the top card of their deck in the centre (face down, no one can look at it). The last defending player in a tied battle becomes the next attacking player, chooses the battle type, and the game continues with the uncovering of the Croks.


5. VICTORY

Whoever wins their sixth group victory wins. Group victories: winning Croks with different group symbols. The game also ends if someone has played their last Crok, in which case the player with more winners wins.
