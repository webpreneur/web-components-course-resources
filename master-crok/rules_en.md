## Simplified rules written by ChatGPT4

In Master Crok, players are leaders of their own Crok (card) teams, competing in a Great Clash. Each player needs a deck (recommended 40 Croks) with no more than one of the same Crok per 10 cards in the deck. Cards have a group symbol, name, ability, and values for power, intelligence, and reflex.

Players shuffle their decks, draw 4 cards, and randomly decide who starts as the attacker, with the others being defenders. Each battle begins with drawing a card. The attacker chooses the battle type (power, intelligence, or reflex) and plays a Crok face-down. Defenders do the same in clockwise order. Once all have played, Croks are revealed, and abilities can be used.

The player with the highest value in the chosen battle type wins. The winning Crok is placed face-down on the other side of the deck, while the losing Croks are placed face-up. The game ends when a player gets their sixth group victory (winning Croks from different groups) or when someone plays their last Crok, in which case the player with the most winning Croks wins.
