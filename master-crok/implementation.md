## How would you implement this in javascript?

Implementing the Master Crok card game in JavaScript is a complex task, but I can give you a high-level overview and some guidance on how to approach it. I will break down the process into smaller tasks:

1. Create data structures:

    - Create a Card class or object to store card properties (group, name, ability, power, intelligence, and reflex).
   - Create a Deck class or object to manage deck operations (shuffling, drawing, and adding cards).
    - Create a Player class or object to manage player operations (playing cards, winning/losing cards, and checking for victory conditions).

2. Set up game initialization:

   - Create players and their decks.
   - Shuffle each player's deck and draw the initial hand.
   - Randomly decide the first attacker.

3. Implement the game loop:

   - While no player has won the game, execute the following steps:
        - Each player draws a card.
        - The attacker chooses the battle type.
        - Each player plays a card face-down in the specified order.
        - Reveal all played cards.
        - Players use abilities in the specified order.
        - Determine the winner of the battle.
        - Update the state of each player (moving winning and losing cards accordingly).
        - Update the attacker for the next round.
        - Check for victory conditions and end the game if met.

This is just a high-level outline of how to implement the game. The actual implementation would involve writing the JavaScript code to define the classes/objects, handle user interaction, and manage the game state. If you need help with specific parts of the implementation or have any questions, please let me know.

## What if i want functional progrommaing instead of oop?

If you prefer to use functional programming instead of OOP, you can achieve the same game logic using plain objects, functions, and higher-order functions. Here's a high-level outline of how to structure the game using a functional approach:

1. Create data structures:

 - Use plain objects to represent cards, decks, and players.
 - Create functions to create and manipulate these objects.

2. Set up game initialization:

 - Create functions to initialize players, decks, and the game state.
 - Use a game state object to store the current state of the game (players, decks, attacker, etc.).

3. Implement the game loop:

 - Create functions for each step of the game loop (drawing cards, choosing battle type, playing cards, using abilities, determining the winner, updating the state, checking for victory conditions, etc.).
 - Use higher-order functions, like map, filter, and reduce, to manipulate the game state and perform operations on collections of data (e.g., players, cards).
 - Compose functions to create the game loop, which will execute the game steps in order while updating the game state.

Here's a rough example of how you might implement some of the data structures and functions:

```javascript
Copy code
// Card creation function
function createCard(group, name, ability, power, intelligence, reflex) {
  return {
    group,
    name,
    ability,
    power,
    intelligence,
    reflex
  };
}

// Deck manipulation functions
function shuffle(deck) {
  // Implement a shuffling algorithm (e.g., Fisher-Yates shuffle)
}

function draw(deck) {
  return deck.pop();
}

function addCard(deck, card) {
  deck.push(card);
}

// Player creation and manipulation functions
function createPlayer(name, deck) {
  return {
    name,
    deck,
    hand: [],
    winningCards: [],
    losingCards: []
  };
}

function drawCard(player) {
  const card = draw(player.deck);
  player.hand.push(card);
}

// ...more functions for other game steps and operations
```

The actual implementation will depend on your preferred functional programming style and library (e.g., Ramda, lodash/fp). This example should give you an idea of how to structure the game using a functional approach. If you need help with specific parts of the implementation or have any questions, please let me know.

## I think i'd like to user angular + ngrx

In that case, you can structure your Master Crok game using Angular as the frontend framework and NgRx for state management. Below is an outline of how to implement the game using Angular and NgRx.

1. Set up Angular components and services:

- Create Angular components for the game board, player area, and card display.
- Create Angular services for managing game logic, such as handling card abilities, determining the winner, and checking victory conditions.

2. Set up NgRx store and actions:

- Create a state object to store the game state (players, decks, attacker, etc.).
- Define actions for each game event (drawing cards, choosing battle type, playing cards, using abilities, updating the state, etc.).
- Create a reducer function to update the game state in response to actions.

3. Implement game logic:

- In the game service, implement functions for each step of the game loop using a functional approach (as described in the previous answer).
- Dispatch actions from the components and services to update the game state in the store.
- Use selectors to get the current state from the store and update the UI accordingly.

Here is a rough example of how you might structure your Angular components, services, and NgRx store:

### Components:

- `GameBoardComponent`: Displays the game board and manages the game loop.
- `PlayerAreaComponent`: Displays a player's hand, deck, and played card.
- `CardComponent`: Displays the card's properties and handles card interactions (such as playing a card or using an ability).

### Services:

- `GameService`: Manages game logic, such as handling card abilities, determining the winner, and checking victory conditions.
- `PlayerService`: Manages player operations, such as drawing cards and updating the winning/losing cards.

### NgRx Store:

- `state`: Define the game state object with properties for players, decks, attacker, etc.
- `actions`: Define actions for each game event (drawing cards, choosing battle type, playing cards, using abilities, updating the state, etc.).
- `reducer`: Create a reducer function to update the game state in response to actions.
- `selectors`: Define selectors to get the current state from the store and update the UI accordingly.

This outline should give you a starting point for implementing the Master Crok game using Angular and NgRx. As you work on the implementation, you might need to adapt the structure to fit your specific requirements and design choices.
