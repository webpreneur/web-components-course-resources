Closures are functions that have access to variables in their outer scope, even after the outer function has returned. In the context of recursion, closures can be used to maintain state and provide persistence between function calls. This can make recursion easier to understand and implement, and can also make it more efficient.

Some benefits of using closures in recursion include:

Maintaining State: Closures allow the recursion to maintain state between function calls, making it possible to keep track of important information without having to pass it as an argument each time.

Memory Efficiency: Closures can reduce memory usage in recursion, as they allow you to keep the state in the closure and avoid having to create new objects for each function call.

Improved Readability: Closures can make code more readable by encapsulating state and reducing the amount of data that needs to be passed between functions.

Debugging: Closures make it easier to debug recursive code, as they provide a way to keep track of the state at each stage of the recursion.

Overall, closures are a powerful tool in recursion and can make code more efficient, maintainable, and readable. It is important to use them correctly to avoid bugs and ensure that the code is performing as intended.

```js
const countDown = (start) => {
    const innerCountDown = () => {
        if (start === 0) {
            console.log('Done!');
            return;
        }
        console.log(start);
        start -= 1;
        innerCountDown();
    };
    return innerCountDown;
};

const countdown = countDown(5);
countdown();
```

In this example, the countDown function returns an inner function innerCountDown, which has access to the start variable in its outer scope. The inner function is then called recursively until start is equal to 0, at which point the recursion stops and the console.log('Done!') statement is executed.

This way of using closures and recursion makes it easy to maintain the state of the start variable, and eliminates the need to pass it as an argument each time the innerCountDown function is called.


## Base Case
The base case provides an **exit point** for the recursive function and prevents it from going into an **infinite loop**. When the base case is reached, the function returns a value and unwinds the previous recursive calls.
